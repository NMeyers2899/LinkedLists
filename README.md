# Linked Lists
This program is meant to demonstrate an understanding of the concept called Linked Lists. A more flexible list of elements that can be useful in a variety of situations where arrays fall short. They link together data that is spread throughout memory instead of data that is close together. The data is held within nodes that have a direct reference to each element ahead and behind it (next or previous). The lists themselves keep track of their first and last element as well as a count of the nodes within the list.
# What to Expect
There are a number of functions in this program that need to be tested thoroughly in order to make sure that they function properly under normal and unconventional circumstances. Here is a step by step process of what is going on behind the scenes when you start the project
- A new list is created.
- The numbers 8, 7, and 10 are added to the list in that order. The list is then printed out to the screen.
- The numbers 15 and 2 are added as well, though pushed to the front and back respectively.
- Since the list is now out of order, the list is then sorted and printed to the screen.
- Lastly, the list is destroyed. If the list is destroyed properly a prompt is given to the user, thanking them.
